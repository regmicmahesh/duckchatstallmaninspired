This application runs completely on top of TCP , and we don't bother with high level protocols such as http, websockets and others. We've a simple run and we don't bother with message segments like request header, request body, crlf and stuffs.

We run a simple protocol that is your message ends with `\n`. How simple is that?

For now, there are few commands such as 

| Command | Description | Example | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/join` | Join? | `/join` | 
| `/quit` | Quit? | `/quit` | 
| `/whisper` | DM? | `/whisper mahesh k xa yar` | 
| `/nick` | Change Nickname? | `/nick mahesh` |
| `/users` | Get Number of Users? | `/users` |
| `/register` | Register User? | `/register mysupersecretpassword` |
| `/login` | Login User? | `/login mysupersecretpassword` |
